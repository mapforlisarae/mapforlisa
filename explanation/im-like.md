I think I give a completely different impression online than what I'm really like.

I'm not all that chatty offline. I like noisy parties but I enjoy my alone time a lot. I don't mind people but I do often get impatient with them. I'm not proud of being so verbose, but it's me coping with the fear that I'll miss something important and end up being unclear or misunderstood.

I don't know what's worse: the paranoia of wondering if you're misunderstood or risking overwhelming people and frustrating them. In your case, I took the risk and it backfired.

You may not relate to this, but I usually feel I'm the one doing the work in a friendship. I show interest, I give in when invited to things, I listen. I don't do it as a chore, but there's usually not much going the other way. It just feels like if I don't extend a hand and show interest, people don't even notice I'm there.

I like being silent with people, when my insecurity doesn't take over. You said as much about yourself, you start getting paranoid about what they're thinking. Do they want me around? Do they even like me at all? Am I bothering them? What do they think of me? Maybe I should go - but what if they take that as me not liking _them_? etc. etc. etc.

Your strategy to get around social anxiety is to not think about what you say or do. When I joke, I _do the same thing you do_, I don't think about it much. The rest of the time, my approach is to be blunt. As I said elsewhere, socially anxious people want others to be honest and straightfoward with them, but that's expecting too much. I try to get around this by setting the example. It doesn't always work well but it has been beneficial for me. I don't know what else to do.

_For the record, I do understand the need to keep track of everything and pay attention to it in a chat room. I'm often doing that myself. It's just that I have an easier time doing it and I'm used to it. I obsess over chat logs and I often end up focusing entirely on the chat. This is in part why I end up talking so much. When I reacted to you feeling uncomfortable about it, it didn't register in my head properly - I just didn't feel like you should have to worry about it. Not used to seeing people express guilt over ignoring messages._

Most people don't like me much when they meet me. I've been told by people that I was friends with, that they hated me when they first met me. I don't always like being polite for the sake of it, or rather, being polite in a way that is expected. Complimenting people without really feeling it makes me very uncomfortable, for example - I feel it makes the honest compliments worthless if I'm not being honest about what I don't like or if I'm not indifferent to it. I usually try to tell people what they can fix instead and sometimes that comes off negatively, which puts me back into talking a lot.

I don't like fights but I don't run away from them either - I think it gives the impression that I'm _looking_ for a fight sometimes. Takes little for me to get impatient with someone but a _lot_ for me to actively dislike or hate them. I have a long fuse, as clearly you do too, but when it goes, it gets nasty.

I've done this many times in the past myself, I now realise. I move on, I don't stick around. I didn't intend to run the server forever, the plan was always to hand it over to Steve and move on. I _expected it_ to trail off and go quiet. I've left communities many times, one day disappearing without a trace. I've never felt anyone was attached to me or cared though. Maybe I missed something, maybe not.

When I close doors on relationships it's forever. Given recent events and thinking about them though, I realise I may have closed some doors far too soon and far too hard in the past. My trust is hard to gain. Being on the recieving end this time, I'd rather try and help you avoid that.

Even if you decide never to talk to me or Antoine again, hopefully all of this will help you process the experience into something more useful than thinking the internet is full of assholes.
