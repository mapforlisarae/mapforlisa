The streams meant a lot to all of us, so did this small group. We weren't just having fun, we were forgetting. Antoine clearly needed them, I know I was unusually _not_ miserable and I think you had some need for them too.

It was an anchor for all of us. You were coping, I was coping and even though Antoine was using it the wrong way, it was helping him cope too. I know you wanted more variety than just me, but the fact is we were the most active members by a large margin, outside of Antoine who spent most of his time being pissy or needy.

When the Discord server came up, we were having _fun_. I can honestly say that first month was _happy_ for me, just because of the occasional chat. I _don't_ mean to make you feel guilty or bad for leaving, _please_ don't take it that way. You should stay out of it if you feel it was too much of a burden or unpleasant. I had the distinct feeling you felt obligated to be there somehow, that when you said you had to keep me in check or not let me be lonely you actually meant it. I think the same feeling caused you to be too generous with your attention towards Antoine and it backfired.

I was _learning_ too. For all the time I've spent trying to understand why people are the way they are, somehow this context was giving me useful input. I've been in chats, on forums, been to college, done different jobs and been through a military service and this was _still_ engaging.

I realised I had misunderstood a lot of people in the past, just by going through this emotional rollercoaster. I think the same applies to you and it'll help you to give understanding it a chance so you can avoid this chaos in the future. I'd rather not have this whole thing make the world look darker and more hostile to you, if I can help it at all (or prevent it in this case).

This whole thing didn't just drive us apart. I think it poisons the reason we were here in the first place: the streams. I don't want any of us to feel weird about watching Steve again. I think that's too high a price just because we didn't know how to deal with each other. I want us to figure it out so we can all go back to the streams, perhaps with some ground rules, and still enjoy them without hard feelings over what is _clearly_ a colossal misunderstanding.

I don't want you to feel betrayed.

I miss that first month on Discord, but I can let it go. I _can't_ leave this as it is though. We _need_ to figure it out. I want _closure_.
