Like you, I've been betrayed, but for me it was familial. My father is the kind of person you've dated and he's done a lot to me over the years. He didn't beat me (well, outside of a couple times) but the sense of betrayal you have from people around you, I've had from within my family, day by day, year by year growing up.

It was only worse in school. I've been treated badly by people I thought were friends, forgotten and ignored by people I expected to show some care and notice that I was struggling. I learned not to trust people. I was _trained_ by my father to not have friends.

You're not the kind of person I interact with online very much at all. Most people I meet are like me, from big cities, used to the internet, chats and communication. Those who don't want to talk just don't. You were too open and honest and I wasn't used to that. All I saw, because I _had_ to, was someone self-absorbed and looking for attention. I never saw who you were: someone who, like me, was in _need_ of friendship and in _need_ of being understood, but was following a different strategy than I was.

I was so happy during the first five weeks on Discord that I wasn't paying all that much attention. I'm sorry about that. I should have funneled my later distrust earlier and trusted my instincts. I was resisting.

When you left for the first time, I felt empty. I didn't understand why at the time but now I understand it was because I felt lonely again. I had been slightly awakened to how lonely I was, a feeling I had been pushing away most of my life. It _did_ occasionally hit me, but not within a context where someone left because it's usually me who leaves.

I was confused, I had to make sense of it and I fell back to my distrust. It's always a priority for me to assume people are untrustworthy, looking to gain something from me and use me. It's self-defense. Hence why I tried to probe you later. I _wanted_ to trust you, but a lifetime of betrayal prevented me from making that step.

Even when I confessed I was unfair to you, I couldn't bring myself to make it a proper apology. Hence the essay. I was still having difficulty trusting you because what you were was hard to believe for me.

When you left the second time, I felt panic. All I could think about was how to repair this. I _knew_ then that not only could I trust you, but that this had been far worse for you than you ever let on. I realised what had been destroyed.

I don't know how to express myself so after thinking about it non-stop for a few days and arriving at what I thought was a decent explanation for what happened, going over the logs and processing everything in my head, I decided the only way I could put this in a form managable was to make a website with it.

When you rejected that, the world came crashing down on me. I realised what I had been pushing away for so long, that I was lonely. Steve's chat's and Discord had remedied that enough to make losing them feel terrifying. I'm pretty sure this is where the motivation for me to start the server came from. I've done nothing but think about this.

If it seems too much progress for a short time, consider that a lot of this was already in my head somewhere all along. When you left, both times, it was an impact that eliminated a lot of possibilities and cleared things up for me. It's still been incredibly difficult.

It has caused a sort of identity crisis for me. I've had to modify the way I think and how I look at everything. The world seems a stranger and stranger, almost nauseating place. I'll get used to this in time, but you should know it was a significant experience for me. All of this was somewhere inside me but it took a lot of guilt, thought and panic to get it out.
