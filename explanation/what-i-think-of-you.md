You think of yourself as a fighter, you push back aggressively when people push you. You learned this back when you were young, when you would be bullied, when you were alone. Anxiety has defined your life. You don't want to be lonely, but people are a source of stress and fear. What they think of you, what they'll do to you.

Being a woman, you have an extra compounding factor, that of trying to protect yourself from being prey. You want to be beautiful, you want to feel you're worth others but it's also what makes men use you. You feel they see you as nothing more than that. It's a blessing and a curse that haunts you.

Your strategy for social interactions is to switch off your brain, to avoid anxiety, otherwise it overwhelms you and you stay quiet or end up saying things you regret immediately - so you just don't think about it.

You're a kind person, something you also learned when you were young, needing care in your anxiety but bullied and segregated instead. Hatefulness, putting others down, bullying, all of these infuriate you. You don't want to hurt people, lead them on, lie or take advantage of them.

You feel you have a personality inside that nobody sees, that people misunderstand you and treat you like you're far less. They treat you unfairly because they can't see who you are and you don't know how to _show_ who you really are.

You don't want to be typical, mundane, ordinary. You don't want to be a normal girl, you want to be _you_. You're attracted to Tim Burton stories because of it. You're solitary, you want people to approach _you_ for once.

When I first saw your art I thought it was too literal. I expected to _feel_ what you wanted to say but I didn't, regardless of whether I find it relatable or not. I thought everyone was like that, feeling stressed to talk to people, insecure about their appearance, which is why so many people rally to the cause of solving these. I thought you had too many words, you _said_ what you wanted someone to get out of your art and it seemed like the wrong way of going about it.

I understand now. You can't easily say what you feel, but you _need_ people to know what you want to say through your art, hence the text, the descriptions, the explicit statement of what your art is about. You _need_ people to understand, you must make sure of it.

I also understand why you shut doors and vow never to open them again. You need to know you're strong, that you won't be taken in again, that you won't forgive someone who's tried to hurt you and be hurt again. I know that feeling too well, I was just never on the recieving end of it.

You have to try to socialize, it wears you down, tires you, but you need it. You try hard to contribute, to be useful, to make a difference, but it also wears you down. Once anxiety takes over from the initial rush and motivation, once you start to get used to things, you eventually get tired and move on. I'm nomadic like that too, I move on. I always move on and it's always been me that does it.

We're not identical and gender does play its role in how we handle things, but we do have a lot of similarities. I never saw these because I didn't think I'd ever meet someone like me in this way, so I always interpreted your behavior differently. Take it from someone like you who's now on the other side of this treatment: not everyone is who they seem at first and who they are isn't sinister. You _know_ people don't see you for who you are. I feel that way, always have - people will say things about me that are completely off course, they will treat me as if I'm a terrible person when I _know_ I'm not because they've misunderstood my actions or words.
