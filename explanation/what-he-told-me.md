He friended me on Discord a few days ago. We spoke.

He seems quite apologetic now. He acknolwedges I was right and although, when I asked him, he said that he might have been more persuadable if I was nicer, he doesn't seem angry about it anymore. I suspect the only reason he wants to come back is to have access to you again. He says he still wants to be in the group and that he's sorry he broke us apart.

I don't know if I believe him, but I do know that he is invested in being back and he seems to have gained the motivation to control himself, for now. If I take him back, it'll be with some rules.

He wants to apologize to you. I told him to leave you alone. I'm telling you this so you know he did want to apologize and it was me that told him to hold it for if and when you're back.

He told me he understood but it felt like he was just parroting what I'd told him about why you left. I'm not sure if he's completely honest or not, or if he does understand, but it won't be like it was before. It was the calmest and most polite I've ever seen him. Granted, he _did_ have the motivation to be calm since he feels I hold the key to something he wants, which I called him out on, so it's up to you to decide whether you want to accept an apology or not.
