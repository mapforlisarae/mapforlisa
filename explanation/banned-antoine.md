I banned him because:
  
  1. It's very likely he'll latch onto someone else once he detaches from you

That's it. I considered that part to be a risk of disruption that involved the server. I can't put up a placard warning people not to give in to his need for constant attention on this. What about the next girl that walks in?

I didn't do it lightly nor was it out of spite, even though I _was_ angry at him. He needed to disconnect and couldn't let go, so that's the benefit on his side. Being on the server was enabling him to keep trying to get something unattainable instead of focusing on recovering and fixing the mess in his head.

I wanted to invite you back as well - how could I do that without giving you some guarantee that what was frustrating in the first place would be removed? That's also why I offered to stay silent if you came back.

He can't be helped in this way, he's way too clingy and it ended up disrupting the group as he had an obsession with one member and an imaginary rivalry with another, that spilled out into main chat as well. He can't control himself the way he is right now.

If he is to come back, it'll have to be with some rules.
