**I hope you take this as what it is: a sincere effort to understand you, understand what happened and demonstrate it so that you can understand as well. I know you don't want to be coddled so I've been direct in my comments and writing here.**

I don't know the way to approach you with this. You've already showed a lot of patience but I need to ask you for a bit more as you read this. It's not a waste of time but I'm not good at expressing myself.

It means a lot to me that you understand what happened. I _need_ to know what I did wrong.

I know I babble, but it's because I'm always terrified I'll be misunderstood. It doesn't help but I don't know what else to do. I overthink what I want to say and it still comes out wrong. I know it doesn't seem like it. I'll try my best with this.

You probably think I'm a horrible person because of things I said and how I treated Antoine. You probably think I'm incapable of understanding you. I have tried to explain why in the rest of the writings on this page. You were so patient before, I hope you can find it in yourself to be patient for a bit with this and give me a chance to explain.

The graphs are our messages over time and what I saw everyone's emotional state to be and what I think people where feeling underneath.

The chat logs are there for demonstration purposes. You don't need to read the entire thing, I've highlighted the parts that I've identified as important and you can skip to them. There's comments with what I thought at the time and now.

My trust is hard to earn, very hard. Somehow you've now earned it
