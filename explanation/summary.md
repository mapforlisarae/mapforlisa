**I hope you take this as what it is: a sincere need to understand what happened and to get _you_ to understand what happened. I don't want you to think I'm a horrible person who doesn't care or isn't interested in understanding others.**

_Take your time._

This site has answers to questions in a format that I hope is easier for you to handle. It also has the full chat log from Discord (no PMs) commented with explanations of what, in retrospect, was actually happening and with how I interpreted things at the time.

There's also the chat logs from Steve's streams, since the day I had written the chat logger. The earliest is from September 25th. Those are similarly commented and highlighted but not nearly as much.

You can directly skip to the days you're interested in and there's highlight bookmarks so you don't have to read the entire thing.

The site will remember the last log you were on so you can come back to it later.

The chart at the top is our messages over time, including the total. The peak is around 1850 messages, in case you were wondering. The second chart is my interpretation of everyone's emotional state: the top bar is what was shown outwards and the bottom is what I think everyone was feeling inside. The time scale is the same as the top graph.

And yes, this is some of the **worst code I've written**, in case it seems crude and buggy. It's hard to do a good job in a hurry.

I'm sending you this because by leaving, you also cut yourself off from the logs, preventing yourself from being able to review things. I'm terrible at being brief as you know already - I'm always terrified that what I want to say will be misunderstood or will be too late. I tried as hard as I could to make this whole thing digestible for you, hence this format.

I can only do so much on my own. I can't be sure what I do or don't understand unless you tell me what I got wrong. I don't expect you to want to come back to the server, but I don't want this to ruin the streams for you or Antoine.

Think about how when you felt depressed and empty, the chat helped you cope with it. It was no different for me. I don't talk much about how I feel, I haven't got a habit for it - I only broke down on the 23rd. But I _do_ understand what it's like.

My trust is hard to earn but it's hard to lose when earned. I decided I trust you.

Discord doesn't require a mutual server for communication, friending is sufficient. Even if you don't come back I hope you'll at least tell me somehow if I'm still wrong. The one thing that should be clear by now is that I don't run away, I don't block people and I don't mind conflict if it has a use. That's _not_ a stab at you or criticism. I mean it as an invitation. If you need to scream in my face that I'm an asshole, I'll listen.

I can sure talk a lot but I promise I'll do my best to go slow and let you set the pace. I don't mind waiting hours or days for a reply. All I want is to get this cleared up and comprehended. I don't expect you to stick around after it either nor is it an attempt to make you warm up to the idea.

_I realise it may feel strange to you, talking to someone who's name you don't know, don't know where they're from or know what they look like, especially when they know these things about you. If you want to know, ask - I just won't put information here._
