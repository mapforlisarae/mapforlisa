  I'll repeat this once again: I have severe difficulty trusting people. If there's anything at stake, I assume people are lying or don't know what they're talking about, by default. It's not necessarily sensible, especially for someone who otherwise consistenly gets irritated at conspiracy theories and cynicism, but I can't always help it.

  You come from a place far smaller than where I'm from. I live in a city about the size of Edinburgh (for reference). It's common for people from small places to expect trust and openess far more than we do. In a big city, it's far more common to run into bullshitters, scam artists and people looking to take advantage of you. I had lots of college friends from towns the size of yours and this difference in how we behaved and treated people was apparent. They _also_ got more paranoid and less trusting while living in the city.

  I couldn't interpret your behavior properly. You're not the kind of person I interact with usually (or ever) when I'm online. By that I mean, not being an online person, your behavior has components that are different and it was confusing to me.

  I didn't realise I was doing this both because it's a habit but also because of context. You were trying so hard to keep up, while also not complaining about it as much as it bothered you and clumsily trying to balance it all, so I just went with what felt most likely: this was intentional behavior that seemed to be purposeful rather than incidental.

  This is why I misinterpreted your pop-ins, your absense and the way you participated when you did. You went through such a gradient of states while in the chat, that it was hard to use one day's behavior to judge the other's. I'm not _blaming_ you for this. I'm explaining why it made it hard for _me_ to understand.

  You deal with the stress of talking to people by switching your brain off and not thinking about what you say. This won't help you feel any better about it, but you need to know it can get you easily misinterpreted a _lot_ of the time unless someone is aware of it. This is part of the reason you got yourself into this whole mess.

  It's not that you're not understanding. You're trying hard to _not_ be overwhelmed by trying to be "not understanding" and it backfires once the short high of joking around wears off and your anxiety returns.
