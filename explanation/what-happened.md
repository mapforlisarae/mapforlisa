**This is a rough overview of what I think happened. Details are in the commented chat logs.**

Antoine got dumped, you didn't know he was a guy so you were openly loving to him in chat, relating to him because you had been dumped. You gained a bit of back-and-forth with him, including some joke flirting (which is why he was so jealous later when we started doing the same). You avoid thinking too much about your interactions so even though you found out he was a guy, you just kept on behaving the same way, for fun and also because you didn't know what else to do.

He latched on to this because he had been dumped and wanted to fill the hole as fast as possible. Someone latching on this hard, as Antoine did, _is_ rare, even on the internet. He's not emotionally strong so even when you told him you thought he was a girl and had misunderstood, it was far too late - he had locked onto you in his mind. Even then, you still behaved the same way except for some cases where he got _way_ too forward. Without wanting to, you had led him on so strong there was no way he was going to let go.

_The chat became poisonous to you when you ended up taking it too seriously. And you **did**._

You didn't want to reject him because you didn't want to hurt him. So you didn't, but in the process of avoiding that, you ended up putting your hand in the fire by being too generous. Your behavior was so inviting, without you realising, that he latched on even more. Eventually, as we started to joke around, he got more and more jealous. He got possessive.

I treated him the same way on stream but he was so paranoid and jealous he couldn't put it out of his mind. Everything bothered him unless it was completely neutral. Neither of you know how to switch off and take a break properly, you're not used to this.

It's been very difficult for me to learn to hurt people a bit to avoid hurting them more later. But it's doable and it helps.

**Since November 12, you were sick and didn't get a break. You stayed ill in one form or another until at least mid December and probably longer. It wore you down emotionally. You started having panic attacks again on top of it. You were _trying too hard to keep up_.**

He started wearing you down, starting by being openly hurt in chat. You offered an ear, which is probably what he was counting on. It didn't help that I re-inforced the idea that this was all benign and it would blow over once you explain to him that you're not interested. I thought he was just a goof. I thought he could take a hint. I also thought you felt comfortable talking about it. I was wrong on all counts.

After a couple of weeks of his PMs, you had enough. You tried using "Do not Disturb" as an indication that you really _didn't_ want to be disturbed but he didn't take the hint. You decided to take a break, probably to avoid triggering him by talking to me or because I had somehow become a nuisance as well. You didn't disconnect completely though, you just reduced your workload to only answering his PMs.

Eventually, after a week of this with no sign of the PM madness from Antoine dying down, you decided it was enough. By this point, I was confused by what was going on. I suspected that he had been PMing you all this time, but I had no idea how you felt about it and thought you were actively avoiding _me_ but I couldn't undestand why either.

You decided to go permanently invisible, so that you could deal with things at your own pace. He decided to try being online for stretches of time waiting for you to reply so he could catch you online and chat in real time. He never picked up on you being worn out apparently.

After you came back, you either missed main chat or wanted to give him a distraction so he would let go of you - probably the latter more than the former. It didn't work as I either wouldn't pick up, usually being the only one around, or when I did it would end up in him being frustrated and craving talking to you more, not less. It also didn't let him think about it - he thought he knew what he wanted.

Within a week of you coming back, I was even more confused about what was going on. I hate being used and I felt like I was being used. It clouded my judgement. I wanted to talk to Antoine but I hesitated. I wanted to PM you and ask about it but I was under the impression you wanted nothing to do with me, certainly not get PMs. I thought all your activity was either maintenance or obligation.

The last week was all confusion, frustration and fatigue. It didn't help that it was also during a busy holiday. I ended up dumping a load of messages on you, when I should have just posted a short apology. You were in such a state that it all was white noise at this point. Logging in meant dealing with a torrent of PMs. When you tried to get things going in main chat, possibly to off-load him again, you ended up accidentally starting fights instead. You would come back confused and angry at the sight, without realising that you were fanning the flames.

It came to a point, I talked to Antoine and I tried to help you disconnect by explaining what I was talking to him about. I tried to make it clear that you could let go and take a break. I did it in a torrent of PMs, which only made things worse. White noise turned to pink noise and you hit your breaking point, right after Antoine hit his.
