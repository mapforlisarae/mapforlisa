  We come from different worlds. My days are spent on a computer, I deal with a lot of complexity all the time and the chat is always up. You spend most of your time offline, almost all of it, doing very different things and when you get online, it's mostly on mobile.

  It was as hard for me to understand you as it is for you to understand that all of this was very very easy to miss, even if you hadn't been too good at hiding it. I never _ignored_ you when you mentioned things in chat, I just didn't comprehend _your context_ because I'm unfamiliar with it. Reading it back makes it clear you were trying to explain, but you moved on from it so fast and it was confusing to me what you meant in the first place.

  You tried too hard, nobody could tell. Your pace is different, I'm not used to it. When you left, I realised how hard it was. You _said_ so but I never realised _what_ you meant - I read those words as if coming from a different kind of person, someone who _could_ keep up.

  I thought you _could_ keep up and when you said you couldn't I didn't realise _what_ was overwhelming you.

  I thought you knew how to say no, how to refuse, but you didn't and it never crossed my mind.

  I was _trying_ to help you let go. I didn't know how to talk to you, you're the kind of person I've never interacted with before online.

  I never considered where you're from. It plays a huge role. I had friends from towns the same size yours is when I was in college. They found most of this stuff overwhelming too. I just never interacted with them online. I go places and talk to people who, unsurprisingly, are more like me than they are like you in this way.

  People like me who are used to this kind of thing have learned to compartmentalize things, pace themselves and switch off when they need to. Clearly, neither you nor Antoine know how to do this, regardless of other factors playing their role. He wasn't overwhelmed solely because he was here for one thing only and he was the one showering you with PMs instead of being spammed all the time.

  You never showed any definite signs of this stressing you. You're so _guarded_. You hid this so well that even though I suspected it was bothering you, I never had anything strong enough to go on that would let me do something about it. I sometimes thought you slowly turned invisible to avoid Antoine and his PMs. Other times I thought you just didn't care. I couldn't decide what was going on.

Sometimes there's people that won't shut up, keep talking and are irritating as fuck. I don't like anyone who's like that. I _hate_ it when I bore people. It's the internet though and I can't read expressions plus you're kind of apprehensive about showing discomfort with people. If I was tiring you out, I'm sorry. I can only try to keep a slow pace.
