<body>
<pre>
I only knew how to forgive others
only knew how to feel fear, guilt and shame
I suffered for my mistakes and they consumed me
until there was nothing left

She only knew how to forgive herself
only knew how to feel indignation
She can't see anything wrong in herself
she can spare others and keep only those who praise her

She lives in a way that makes it harder for her to turn around
and see what she leaves behind

She won't look because she can't

---

My world opened up and I saw hope, I felt alive
and she took it away twice, shunned me twice
In her eyes I had no rights, no soul to hurt
no pain to overcome

She felt only her own kind of pain existed
she talked about it, justified everything by it

My feelings had no value to her
they were either too small or too late

She broke me and felt nothing

But I was reborn from my ashes

My world is darker, scarier, more hostile now
but inside I glow a bit brighter
