Pick up the \ud83e\udd5a from the floor that you dropped at step 0 (told you to be careful but you didn't read it!)\n 3.  Cook the \ud83e\udd5a remains using \ud83d\udd0d and \ud83c\udf1e . It might take a while but keep at it.\n 4. Make sure the \ud83c\udf64 remains happy. Use coersion if necessary.\n 5.  Combine \ud83e\udd55 \ud83e\udd54 and \ud83c\udf68 in a \ud83e\udd59 . Make sure the \ud83c\udf68 is thoroughly melted before combining. Discard \ud83c\udf68 bowl before melting it.\n 6. Ensure \ud83c\udf1d is in the proper phase (determine proper phase by looking at \ud83c\udf1e through \ud83c\udf83 - moon phase must match smile)\n 7. Chop \ud83c\udf4c into 12 slices or more and melt \ud83c\udf6b on the _top side_ of each slice\n 8. Add \ud83c\udf7a to \ud83c\udf4c + \ud83c\udf6b and simmer in \ud83c\udf73 \n 9. Add the missing \ud83e\udd5a (egg _must_ have been lost and found before \ud83d\udd0d ! This is why step 0 was missing)\n 10. Combine ingredients in \ud83c\udf73 with \ud83e\udd5a, place into \ud83c\udf71  and discard \ud83e\udd59 with \ud83c\udf68 \ud83e\udd55 \ud83e\udd54 (because it's disgusting, that was just to make the steps 10)\n 11. Perform prayer of your choosing over \ud83c\udf71 (you'll need it)\n 12. Serve with \ud83c\udf5f \n 12.5 Do _not_ feed to \ud83d\udc31 or \ud83d\udc36\n 13. <:cheers:376541105954488321> \ud83e\udd42 <:steve_nose:376541105379999754>"],
