He didn't show awareness of the effect it has on others even when told and shown directly. Taking breaks didn't help and trying to be patient didn't help, including on his own part.\n\nHe needs proper professional help as I've already told him. He couldn't disassociate himself, so I'm taking initiative here and doing it for him. I'm banning him to prevent him from having access to further substitutes amongst this group since Discord doesn't allow PMs if you don't have someone on your friends list or share a server that allows PMs.\n\nIf this was a _personal_ issue, it would be between him and whoever is having the problem - blocking would have sufficed and I wouldn't have banned him.\n\nThis is both for his own good and to protect everyone else who may not be prepared to deal with it, including new members that join in the future. Being here was unhelpful and unhealthy for him and it ended up being so for others.", "I thought everyone would hate me for banning Antoine. I was expecting to lose a few people after doing this.

They will _never_ be applied lightly. They will _never_ be applied for personal issues, _even if they exist with me_ so once more, you are free to give me a mountain of shit for this if you feel like it. I hope this has been clear from the start.\n\nTaking advantage of the group's generosity and kindness and of those within it will _not_ be tolerated, even if unintentional but _especially_ if the behavior doesn't cease and _especially_ if it's likely to be repeated. Protecting kind people always takes priority over those who are not, regardless of whether they mean it, otherwise we might as well be punishing kindness.\n\nI think it was important to do this sooner rather than later and perhaps I was too cautious and waited too long already."],
